    <description>
	<p>Stellarium renders 3D photo-realistic skies in real time with OpenGL. It displays stars, 
	constellations, planets and nebulae, and has many other features including multiple panoramic 
	landscapes, fog, light pollution simulation and a built-in scripting engine.</p>
	<p>Stellarium comes with a star catalogue of about 600 thousand stars and it is possible to 
	download extra catalogues with up to 210 million stars.</p>
	<p>Stellarium has multiple sky cultures - see the constellations from the traditions of 
	Polynesian, Inuit, Navajo, Korean, Lakota, Egyptian and Chinese astronomers, as well as 
	the traditional Western constellations.</p>
	<p>It is also possible to visit other planets in the solar system - see what the sky 
	looked like to the Apollo astronauts, or what the rings of Saturn looks like from Titan.</p>
